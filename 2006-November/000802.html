<PRE>Hi Pieter, Hi all

In our applications, it's common to have the option for more than one 
language. This requires that we have translation files with translated 
strings, eg, YDWeblog has translation files and my simple application 
(based on the YDCM draft) too.

I propose to have a YDF repository of translated strings.
The good on this is that that, in our applications, we can use that 
strings (we don't need to reinvent the wheel every time) and these 
strings can be automatically translated/updated (because we have 
contributors in different languages).

Apart from that, i propose to define a common way for those strings. 
Here goes my ideas:

  - create a YDF directory for translations (eg: YDFramework2/translations)

  - create a subdirectory for each context.
Eg, for strings related to users, create a 
YDFramework2/translations/users/ directory. For generic strings (eg: 
'add', 'delete') create a generic directory 
YDFramework2/translations/generic/

  - for each language we have a file inside each directory. Eg, if we 
have english and portuguese we would have in users translation directory 
these files:
YDFramework2/translations/users/en.php
YDFramework2/translations/users/pt.php
or
YDFramework2/translations/users/language_en.php
YDFramework2/translations/users/language_pt.php

  - inside each file we could have a structure to define:
* permissions
* labels
* return messages (that can be ok messages, error or form errors)

I propose that a string should start by the context name, then type and 
then name.
Eg, in users,
permissions could be:
  $GLOBALS['t']['users perm edit'] = ...
  $GLOBALS['t']['users perm delete'] = ...

labels could be:
  $GLOBALS['t']['users label username'] = ...
  $GLOBALS['t']['users label email'] = ...

messages could be:
  $GLOBALS['t']['users mess deleteok'] = ...
  $GLOBALS['t']['users mess emailnotvalid'] = ...


This can be a huge help for all developers, they only need to use the 
directory they want ( first defining the current language with 
YDLocale::set() and then including the directory with 
YDLocale::addDirectory() ), and if a string is missing, it can be added 
and translated to other languages in a short time.
Of course, in this initial phase, the port can be time consuming, but i 
think its a good practice.


What do you think?

regards
Francisco A
