<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> Well, we can install php-gettext or use this project
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://upgradephp.berlios.de/">http://upgradephp.berlios.de/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This solve problem with gettext suport.
</I>
I have installed upgradephp to get in more detail how it works i seems 
good. There are lots of functions ported and that's great.

Gettext is ported too, and this means that:

&#183; Speed won't suffer on up-to-date servers, because functions are
   only emulated/deifned if they are missing (all function_exists
   checks are built-in; you don't have to care).

&#183; Emulated functions sometimes run slower than the native variant
   would, but it generally shouldn't be slower than any workaround
   you used for the [advanced but not widely available] functions
   until now.

Excellent.. remember that we have some workaround created already. This 
way we don't need to care.


&#183; If you yourself want to use a PHP application or projects, which
   depends on features not available on your server and so breaks.

My support worry is not a problem anymore.


How to use? Simpler is impossible

   if (PHP_VERSION &lt; &quot;4.3.0&quot;) { include(&quot;upgrade.php&quot;); }


and we get the HUGE list with MORE THAN 150 functions !!!
including:

&#183; stripos
&#183; strripos
&#183; str_ireplace
..
&#183; array_key_exists
&#183; array_intersect_assoc
&#183; array_diff_assoc
..
&#183; is_a
..
&#183; gettext
&#183; bindtextdomain
..


&gt;<i> Gettext isnt a wheel reinventing.  and to create new translations is
</I>&gt;<i> very easy,  there was at least 3 editor to it.
</I>&gt;<i> My mother can translate one program with gettext suport but with
</I>&gt;<i> strings php in a file, is more difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But you are right,  each project has your own way to keep translations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Im just getting my opinion, because sometimes I translate projects
</I>&gt;<i> (despite my bad english :) ,   and its more , more easy translate
</I>&gt;<i> project with gettext than others.
</I>
Sure.
I have downloaded poEdit (the gettext editor for windows) and i must say 
this makes translations a piece of cake for 2 reasons:

1- it includes all gettext command line tools internally.

2- i only need to define the YDF directory and it scans all php files 
for translation strings and computes all new strings and deprecated strings!

This makes the developer life much more easy.. The developer only need 
to worry about the code and it don't need to worry about creating or 
even maintaining the translation files! poEditor does that for you.

I must admit that we should give a try on this.

What do you think?

Francisco A
