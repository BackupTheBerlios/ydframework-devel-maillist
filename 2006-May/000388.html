<PRE>Hi all

Currently, we have a good start draft about Content Management components.

We have a master component class that involves logic about:
- content tree management
- user management
- content locking (to control multi-edition)
- language management
- auditing (to store user actions)

and we have some initial component structures:
- pages
- rootmenus
- links
- guestbook

After some time analysing the weblog db scheme i think we have already a 
good start to porting. The weblog structure can be (easily, i think) be 
converted to use all the power of the YDCM.

As you can see, the structure is identical:

- 'categories' are 'rootmenus'
   these are elements with just a title that can have any caind of child

- 'comments' are a part of a guestbook
    basically we can convert this making a guestbook node that
    has a page as parent.

- 'items' and 'pages' are identical
   (maybe a merge here?)

- 'links' have a YDCM component created named 'link'
   these are nodes that can be saved as menu children

- 'statistics' have YDCMStatistics_visits correspondence

- 'users' have YDCMUsers correspondence


Well.. open the current DBDesigner file and understand how YDCM is 
structured. In the latest build it's much more clear.


- What's your opinion about that structure?

- What's your opinion about porting some weblog methods to YDCM modules?



regards
Francisco A
