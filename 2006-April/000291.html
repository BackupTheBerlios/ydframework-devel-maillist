<PRE>Hi Pieter
&gt;<i> Just to be clear, the forum part was not written by me. The stuff in 
</I>&gt;<i> the examples/cms directory is.
</I>Ufff.... ;)

&gt;<i> I never got my head around YDDatabaseObject to be honest, but I guess 
</I>&gt;<i> I should start looking into it.
</I>Yes, i was using the common YDDatabase for db operations but with 
YDDatabaObject it's much much easier..
&gt;<i> I'm just wondering what would be the easiest way of combining 
</I>&gt;<i> YDDatabaseObject with YDDatabaseTree for the CMS part. I do want to 
</I>&gt;<i> have the modular approach, but also the hierarchical approach of items 
</I>&gt;<i> having parents and children. Add on top of that the multilingual part, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is key in this, and you get a difficult combination, believe me.
</I>I was thinking about that some time ago too.. and i think i found a cool 
way of doing this. The concept is.. everything is a component (eg, page, 
guestbook.. etc) and these components must be part of a tree that 
represents the whole portal. The first nodes of a portal must be always 
menus (component menu).
Then, i will have a portal that starts like the next image where all 
first nodes of the portal must always be menus:

Portal tree

Inside a menu we can create any other component.. Eg we can create pages 
(that are html/xhtml content).

Each menu has a &quot;reference&quot;. &quot;Reference&quot; is a internal label that 
defines the menu name. In the menu properties we must define the real 
name for all portal languages.
For a page component we must do the same... a page has a &quot;reference&quot; and 
a title and content for each language.

This is the simpler way but for expert admins, it's possible to, eg, 
create a guestbook that is a child of a page.. this means that the 
guestbook will not appear in the menu (because it's not a direct child) 
but will appear rendered in the bottom of the page (when the visitor 
enters that page).

So, this is the concept i made.. a hierarchical component system, with 
multi-language (every component has multi-language but only displays the 
correspondent &quot;reference&quot; in the administrator menu).

Now, how is this done.. Basically, every component has this parts:
- dbobject
- phobject
- template directory added to the master template directory
- languages directory

A dbobject is a class that extends YDDatabaseObject as has all methods 
about this component and how it handles its db operations.

A phobject is a class (optionaly extends YDRequest) that cares about 
forms, templating and only _uses_ dbobject methods

Every component has its own template(s) but we need to store that 
directory inside a common directory (eg, &quot;templates) to permit the use 
of skins. Then if the component is a &quot;guestbook&quot; we will have a 
&quot;guestbook&quot; directory inside all possible skins. Eg:
+ templates
                +  default
                |            +  page
                |            + guestbook
               + orange
                            + page
                            + guestbook

Every component has its own language strings and own language directory.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I like the approach an application like Drupal (drupal.org 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://drupal.org">http://drupal.org</A>&gt;) takes for implementing the modules, but the way 
</I>&gt;<i> they added multi-lingual content is really bad and far from working.
</I>I don't know the drupal internals..

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Francisco, would you mind putting together a small example using 
</I>&gt;<i> YDDatabaseObject to illustrate how you would see the module 
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure working for the CMS part?
</I>
Take a look to how the db is organized...
DBscheme

Content_tree is the portal tree. Every row is a component and every 
component has common attributes (like 
state:published/notpublished/approval.., publish schedule, ...). So, 
this is generic.

Then, like a said above, every direct child of the root must be a menu.. 
and what is a menu? well, its just a component that has a title (that 
depends of the language.. and that's way it's related with the languages 
table).

For pages, we have component_page that has specific attributes for pages 
(eg: metatags, html..) and it's related with languages too..

Then we have users that have it's own language (for administration) and 
are related with the tree because we want locks. Locks are information 
that defines that a user is, eg, editing a component. This way we don't 
have more than one user editing.

And we have other tables too (for configurations, statistics..) but 
these are what you want for component definition.


What you think?

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Pieter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I saw your initial commit about the cms and forum.. and i think we
</I>&gt;<i>     could
</I>&gt;<i>     share some ideas about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     IMHO, a content framework must:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - _not_ include specific code (eg: design/templating code),
</I>&gt;<i>     otherwise in
</I>&gt;<i>     most cases it will be useless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - should be a collection of modules that have all _logic_ about all
</I>&gt;<i>     possible operations about that module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I saw that you are creating some modules extending a sqlclass
</I>&gt;<i>     (that has
</I>&gt;<i>     only a simple contructor about a connection).. and this doesn't seems
</I>&gt;<i>     the best approach because almost all forum logic implements what
</I>&gt;<i>     YDDatabaseObject already does (updates/deletes/inserts...).. all
</I>&gt;<i>     we need
</I>&gt;<i>     is a YDDatabaseObject extension and 80% of the job about the forum is
</I>&gt;<i>     done ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I propose that every module (eg: forum) has:
</I>&gt;<i>     - a YDDatabaseObject extension that contains all possible operations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - a language directory that contains all language files about the
</I>&gt;<i>     module
</I>&gt;<i>     (no news here)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - a sql directory that contains the sql needed and a DBDesigner4
</I>&gt;<i>     source
</I>&gt;<i>     file (this is free and excellent for db designing and exporting)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ... and these, imho, could be included has a &quot;ydf addon/module&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     or  &quot;ydf
</I>&gt;<i>     cm addon/module&quot; and not has a example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     .. in the ydf &quot;example&quot; directory i think we could add a
</I>&gt;<i>     demonstration
</I>&gt;<i>     class (that uses the YDDatabaseObject extension about that module) and
</I>&gt;<i>     the correspondent templating directory that shows how the module
</I>&gt;<i>     works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     .. just my 0.02
