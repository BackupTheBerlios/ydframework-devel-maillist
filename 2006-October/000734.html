<PRE>  Hi Francisco,

This sounds like a great idea. It would be a good alternative to views.I really like the proposal for filter ranges rather than individualvalues.

You should also think about ways to set defaults that allow filteredfields to be automatically populated for insert and update clauses.That way the filter can be used for reads and writes.

My modification to YDDatabaseTree does this. I mentioned that I wasworking on that some time ago. Have a look at:
  
   setFilterByArray  
   setAddDefaults  
   getFilter  
   _getFilter  
   getWhereFilter
  
 in the attached. I haven't had the time to put together an updatedexample.

I haven't spent much time on it but it works for the purpose ofallowing multiple trees to be stored in a single table.

YDDatabaseTree seems to be based on pure SQL and could certainlybenefit from a change to base it on YDDatabaseObject.

Regards,

Graeme

Hi db, Hi allI have an idea about sql and a way to handle filters in a automated wayand i would like to discuss with you the best way to create it.Currently we have YDDatabaseObject that handles db operations, but what doyou think of a new object (that integrates with YDDatabaseObject) tohandle filters?All select results are (almost) always diaplayed in tables and we havefilters for that. Filters are just pre-defined 'where' clauses.Imagine a cars table:CAR  | COLOR | PRICEfiat | red   | 100ford | red   |  10audi | blue  |  99We could define pre-defined filters:- user can filter by 'color' value- user can filter by 'price' intervalThis could be done as:$filter = new YDDatabaseFilter();$filter-&gt;addField( 'color', 'is', array( 'red', 'blue' ) );$filter-&gt;addField( 'price', 'between', 5, 500 );this filter means that color must be 'red' or 'blue' and price must bebetween '5' and '500'.How to use the filter====================The filter can have 2 uses: - be displayed with master
 select results as a form - be used to create result with YDDatabase (on a response) when displayed ============== $filter-&gt;toHTML(); or $form = &amp; $filter-&gt;getForm(); returns the html/form code needed to manage the filter. in the previous example this will generate a YDForm with 2 elements'color' and 'price'. - 'color' will be a 'select' box with values 'red' and 'blue' - 'price' will be a 'text' element where the user will set the price wewants. when integrated with YDDatabaseObject ===================================== $dbObject-&gt;resetValues(); $dbObject-&gt;userFilter( $filter ); $dbObject-&gt;findAll(); this means that our YDDatabaseObject will read the filter and apply all'where' internally. basically, in the example, this is the same as doing it by hand like: $dbObject-&gt;resetValues(); $dbObject-&gt;set( 'color', $color_value ); $dbObject-&gt;set( 'price', $price_value ); $dbObject-&gt;findAll();This seems a good feature to me, that can make development much moreeasier :)Imagine..  *
 more complex filters (and how they could be automated)...  * saving filters in db..What do you think?Francisco A_______________________________________________YDFramework-devel mailing <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ydframework-devel">listYDFramework-devel at lists.berlios.dehttps</A>://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ydframework-devel
