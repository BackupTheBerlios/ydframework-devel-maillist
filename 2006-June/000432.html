<PRE>Hi guys,

For a long time I'm thinking of fixing YDDatabaseObject to be smarter when
working with multiple joins. Like when we want to load a relation, and load
another relation in those objects that were loaded, and so on. Then we can
search in all of them. We can't do that now. Today the class works fine only
with 3 objects in a relation and if you want to add more you have to tweak
it a little bit and it's not good.

The problem is that to fix it I have to change the class behavior. We'll
have to check for the relations that were loaded and not the relations
passed to the find() function. This could break a lot of existing code.

In my analysis this change will only affect find actions. For example, now
we can do this:

$user = YDDatabaseObject::getInstance( 'user' );
$user-&gt;id = 123;
$user-&gt;find( 'group' );

This code will find a user with id = 123 and will join the &quot;group&quot; relation
to the query. After the changes are implemented we'll have to do this:

$user = YDDatabaseObject::getInstance( 'user' );
$user-&gt;load( 'group' );
$user-&gt;id = 123;
$user-&gt;find();

So the query will include only the loaded relations. Doesn't look that
complicated in this example, but if you use the same $user object after that
and doesn't reset() it you could have problems. For example:

$user = YDDatabaseObject::getInstance( 'user' );
$user-&gt;load( 'group' );
$user-&gt;id = 123;
$user-&gt;find();

// do something

$user-&gt;id = 2344;
$user-&gt;load( 'event' );
$user-&gt;find();

The last query will join the &quot;event&quot; AND &quot;group&quot; relations because both of
them are loaded. The solution is to add a reset() between them or get
another instance of the class.

So my options are:

1. Change it and we'll manage to fix our current codes
2. Create a new class (YDDatabaseObject2 for example)
3. Another suggestion.

I'm looking forward for your input.

Thanks,
