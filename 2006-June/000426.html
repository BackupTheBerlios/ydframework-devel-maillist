<PRE>Hi everybody, hi Francisco,

You're totaly right, the reason we didn't used the YDDatabaseObject in
our application is that due to short delais we didn't have time to go
through it.
I recently took the time to look deeper at it and it definitively rocks
! I still have to learn few things about its behavior, in such a way to
preserve performances, and then I'll try to refactor the forum data
access layer.
Anyhow, I'm happy to see the YDCM becoming a reality and I would be very
pleased to try and contribute to it, perhaps the forum could extend
YDCMComponent, I'll watch for.

Kind regards,

Erwan.
